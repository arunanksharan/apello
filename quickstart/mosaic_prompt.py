Portfolio Strategy & Diversification

Q: Why is diversification so important for Mosaic? You mentioned offering one of the most diversified funds.
A: We aim to provide a granular portfolio of 25–30 securities across different sectors. Diversifying significantly across BBB and A- rated portfolios helps reduce overall risk. A single bond, whether BBB or AAA, can have binary outcomes (e.g., DHFL went from AAA to D with low recovery). Therefore, building a diversified portfolio, either personally or via professionals like us, is crucial. The key is to diversify enough to mitigate not just idiosyncratic company risk but also sector risk. This is a first-principles approach for this fund.

Q: How many securities will you have across the three sectors?
A: The portfolio will have 25-30 securities:
 10-13 in financials,
 5-6 in real estate, and
 10-12 in structured finance.
This ensures balanced and diversified exposure across sectors.

---
Portfolio Management & Influences

Q: Who are your role models for managing portfolios like this?
A: Our approach is inspired by best practices in the industry:
 Foreign banks in India (e.g., Standard Chartered, Deutsche, HSBC) excel at opportunistically dialing up or down credit risk.
 International funds like Apollo, Bain, SC Lowy, Goldman Sachs, and Blackstone maintain diversified mandates.
We believe in diversification and dynamism, recognizing that credit sectors perform cyclically, requiring sector-neutral strategies for optimal portfolio management.

---
Investor Communication & Services

Q: How will you communicate about your portfolio?
A: We will provide regular updates, including:
 Unit-related communications: Welcome letters, statements of accounts (on allotment, quarterly, and at repayments).
 Investment-related updates: Quarterly newsletters, annual fund/valuation updates, industry insights, and con-calls with large investors as needed.
 Tax-related communications: Annual Form 64C and quarterly TDS certificates.

Q: Will I be able to contact customer service for tax or accounting queries?
A: Yes, a dedicated desk and investor relations (IR) office will handle all your queries.

---
Investment Process & Mechanics

Q: How will you take, invest, and return money to investors?
A: We plan to take 25% of your investment [each quarter] over the next four quarters [in 2025] and return it in tranches in 2029 [and 2030]. Investors will receive quarterly coupon payments of 9-10% during the term. Capital from maturing instruments will be reinvested, and all coupon cash flows will be passed on to investors. [The principal is expected to be returned fully by 2029/2030].

Q: How will my fund be taxed?
A: The fund is a pass-through entity, meaning only TDS will be deducted at applicable rates. Investors must discharge their tax liabilities after taking TDS credits. We will provide Form 64C annually and TDS certificates quarterly.

---
Investment Criteria & Scope

Q: What kind of firms will you invest in—only performing ones?
A: Yes, we invest exclusively in performing firms. These firms must meet stringent criteria:
 Financial Health: Manageable leverage, strong coverage ratios, and competitive margins.
 Security: Tangible, enforceable collateral (no shared collateral).
 Cash Flow: Facilities must be supported by cash flows rather than relying solely on collateral.
 External Environment: Favorable credit conditions from perspectives of competition, group financial strength, policy, and geopolitics.
We avoid:
 Firms and industries competing with China.
 Firms in significant capex cycles, those facing intense competition, or heavily reliant on state government receivables.
 Non-bankable assets or areas where banks won’t lend.
We do not speculate on turnarounds or active change management. Our focus is on assets that are non-bankable for regulatory or capital cost reasons. Our experienced team, backed by case studies and a vigilant Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and Investment Committee (IC), helps us navigate risk effectively.

Q: So no venture debt or distress?
A: Correct. We avoid venture debt and distressed investments. Our focus is solely on firms with no incipient stress, ensuring stability and predictable returns.

---
Deal Origination & Capabilities

Q: Give me some idea of your deal-making capabilities.
A: Our investment research and risk team will consist of over 10 members. Key capabilities include:
 Real Estate: Concluded 250+ transactions with 140 builders over the past decade. We are currently in discussions with two dozen builders to identify promising deals.
 Financials: Managed ₹10,000 crore of mid-sized NBFC books. These firms are profitable, lowly levered (<3.5x), high CAR (>20%), retail-focused, and investment grade.
 Structured Finance: Managed portfolios worth ₹20,000 crore. Trades are sourced through relationships, funds (onshore/offshore), consulting firms, Big4, boutique investment banks (O3, Spark, I-Sec, etc.), smaller advisors, and banks (foreign and domestic).
We anticipate originating at least 50% of our trades directly.

---
Strategy Differentiation

Q: How is your strategy different from others?
A: Mosaic Funds offer a differentiated approach:
 1. Diversification Across Multiple Sectors: Unlike many sectoral funds (NBFC-only, RE-only), we combine uncorrelated assets (NBFC, RE, Structured Finance) to mitigate risk and provide better yield with a fixed-income feel, using around 30 assets.
 2. Ability to Originate Transactions Ourselves: Our large, senior team originates over 50% of deals directly in NBFC, structured finance, and real estate, saving 1-2% in investment banking fees for investors.
 3. Risk Management: Our team has 200+ years of experience across multiple cycles (2000, 2008, 2015, 2020) and is philosophically exit-focused, aiming to be the first out if issues arise, contrasting with peers who may work longer on turnarounds.
 4. Independent, Unconflicted Franchise: As pure fund managers without distribution, NBFC, or other conflicting businesses, our views are unconflicted.

Sector Focus: Structured Finance & Market Dynamics

Q: How much of your portfolio is invested in structured finance, and what does it do?
A: At least 50% of our portfolio is allocated to structured finance opportunities. This segment invests across industries using various structures, targeting opportunities underserved by regulated capital pools such as banks or NBFCs.

Q: I hear there is more demand for high-yield performing credit than the supply of papers. Is that true?
A: Yes, performing credit portfolios are still small (total fund pool ~₹20-25k crore, annual deployment ~1/3rd of that) but expected to grow tenfold over the next decade. Mutual fund participation has declined significantly (from potentially ₹200k crore today vs. actual ₹25k crore), creating more opportunities for structured credit funds.

Q: Why will this segment improve?
A: Structured finance performs well during capex cycles, periods of equity volatility, or accelerated growth—all likely over the next few years. These conditions create opportunities in equity substitution and regulatory arbitrage.

---
Sector Focus: Financials (NBFCs) & Investment Scope

Q: You plan to invest 20-30% in financials. What kind of financiers will you lend to?
A: We will lend to profitable, retail-focused, mid-sized NBFCs with low leverage (<3.5x), high CAR (>20%), and investment-grade ratings. These firms are templated for stability and consistent returns.

Q: Will you consider distress debt, special situations, or venture debt?
A: No, we avoid distressed and venture debt, which have low-probability, high-gain equity-like payoffs. Our portfolio relies on structuring, regulatory arbitrage (flexibility and equity substitution), and investor herding opportunities for stable returns, not betting on distressed firms.

Q: Is there stress building up in NBFCs?
A: Yes, stress will increase as the cycle normalizes, but it's different from 2018. Retail-focused NBFCs today are better capitalized, have less wholesale business, improved ALM (Asset Liability Management), and benefit from proactive policy measures. Regulatory policies are easing, but we remain mindful of unsecured portfolios and will only add secured NBFCs.

Q: How is today different from the 2018 NBFC crisis?
A: The 2018 crisis resulted from tight monetary policy, weak real estate markets (RERA, high inventory), and poor ALM (CP reliance). Today's environment features a thriving real estate market (low inventory, rising prices), better capitalized NBFCs with robust ALM, and potential rate cuts. While stress will increase, it offers opportunities to invest in good NBFCs at higher spreads.

---
Sector Focus: Real Estate (RE) Strategy & Rationale

Q: Why include real estate (RE) in your portfolio?
A:
 Diversification: RE adds uncorrelated risks.
 Macro Tailwinds: Favorable conditions due to low inventory, rising prices, and industry consolidation.
 Developer Finance Opportunity: A ₹150,000 crore market (₹115,000 crore non-LRD funding). Early-stage funding (approx. 1/4th) offers yields of 18-19%.
 Local Nature: RE has fewer macro risks, better management (post-RERA), and auto-deleveraging properties.

Q: How has RERA impacted real estate finance?
A: Post-RERA, 70% of collections must go toward construction and lender payments, unlike pre-RERA where funds were often misused. This legitimized RE finance as structured finance and significantly reduced completion risks.

Q: What kind of developers and projects will you target?
A:
 Developers: Mid-sized developers with proven track records, independent of political affiliations, strong repayment histories, and with whom we have worked at least 3 times previously. We avoid unfamiliar developers or those with patchy histories.
 Projects: Mid-sized projects (1-5 lakh sq. ft.), easier to execute and sell within 3-4 years. We avoid larger projects (>1 million sq. ft.) due to longer completion times (5-7 years) and management difficulty, unless by top-tier developers.

Q: What returns do you expect from RE trades?
A: Approval-stage finance, our primary focus, yields 17-20% on average. (Land-stage: 18-24%, Construction finance: 10-14%, LAP: 9-11%).

Q: How important is collateral in your RE trades?
A: We ensure a minimum of 2x land and cash flow cover. Primary reliance is on cash flow cover, with collateral as a safeguard. All cash flows are controlled via escrow accounts.

Q: I’ve heard that real estate (RE) strategies didn’t perform well in the past few years. Why would things be different now?
A: RE is cyclical. 2015-19 faced challenges (inventory overhang, price stagnation, over-leverage, regulatory/financial tightness), impacting premium/affordable housing funds. Improvements since then include: Price recovery (>20%), better regulation (RERA improving cash flow trapping), streamlined approvals, and developer consolidation. Current inventory levels are at a 15-month low (lowest since 2014), affordability has improved, and decreased competition from NBFCs/banks creates opportunities for AIFs.

Q: What segment of RE will you focus on?
A: Mid-sized projects (1-5 lakh square feet) executable/sellable within 3-4 years, reducing execution/sales risks and offering better predictability compared to larger projects (1 million+ sq ft needing 5-7 years).

Q: What returns can you expect from these RE trades? (Duplicate, see above)
A: Our focus, approval-stage finance, averages 17-19% returns.

Q: How important is collateral in your RE trades? (Duplicate, see above)
A: Crucial but secondary to cash flow cover (min 2x cover). Primary reliance on cash flow, collateral as fallback, escrow control.

Q: What type of developers will you invest in? (Duplicate, see above)
A: Mid-sized, proven track record, timely repayments, politically independent, worked with at least 3 times before. Avoid unfamiliar or patchy history developers.

Q: Why is there a preference for mid-sized projects? (Duplicate, see above)
A: Easier execution/sale (3-4 years), reduced risks, better predictability vs. large projects (1M+ sq ft, 5-7 years).

Mosaic Fund Explained

Q: Could you explain the Mosaic Fund?
A: The Mosaic Fund is a diversified, performing credit fund (Category II AIF). It invests across financials, real estate, and corporate finance, focusing only on firms with no incipient stress and no default history.
 Investment: Minimum ₹1 crore (unless an accredited investor).
 Onboarding: Fully digital process via your advisor.
 Drawdown: Capital is taken in four tranches of 25% each quarter during 2025.
 Returns: Aims for 13-14% net returns over 4-5 years. Investors receive a quarterly coupon of 9-10%. Excess returns and capital are typically returned in the 4th and 5th years (by 2029/2030).
 Structure: Designed for steady income (quarterly coupon) with most gains back-ended. Speak to your advisor for detailed understanding.

Investment Landscape: Fixed Income & AIFs

Q: What are the choices in fixed income for investors?
A: Fixed income choices include:
 Mutual Funds: For liquidity (liquid/liquid-plus funds) or betting on interest rates (dynamic bond, income, medium-term funds). Offer duration and liquidity funds.
 Alternate Investment Funds (AIFs): For sustainably earning high yield. Mosaic is an alternate fund house offering high-yield products.

Q: What are Alternate Investment Funds?
A: AIFs are SEBI-regulated pooled investment vehicles, similar to mutual funds, but for sophisticated investors. They pool money to invest in diverse securities, passing returns (after fees) to investors.

Q: What are the differences between Mutual Funds and Alternate Investment Funds?
A: The key difference is tax treatment.
 Mutual Funds: Taxed only upon withdrawal/redemption.
 AIFs: Function as if securities are held directly by the investor (pass-through). Tax incidence occurs directly for the investor upon portfolio churn (buy/sell), not just withdrawal.

---
Credit Fund Types & Risk/Return Profiles

Q: What is meant by performing credit funds?
A: Performing credit funds invest only in firms currently performing well, with no cyclical or other distress, good quality management, and low likelihood of future stress based on analysis. The lender expects repayment under similar financial conditions. Distressed funds are the opposite, betting on turnarounds of defaulted firms (riskier, higher potential return). Special situation funds fall in between, investing in unique evolving scenarios.

Q: What is the difference between the risk of credit funds and equities?
A:
 Equity: A bet on growth (P&L). Risk arises if growth disappoints relative to expectations. Can be volatile.
 Credit: A bet on survival (Balance Sheet). Can deliver returns even with no growth if the balance sheet is decent.
Both have extinction risk if firms die, but failure is often accelerated in equity, while credit failure usually takes longer.

Q: Can these performing credit funds give returns like equities?
A: Yes, typically, a decent performing credit fund has delivered returns comparable to equity over long periods (e.g., last 20 years), although the risk profiles are very different.

---
Investor Profile & Suitability

Q: What kind of investors are performing funds good for?
A: Performing credit funds are suitable for sophisticated, typically wealthier investors who do not require liquidity for the invested amount over the lock-in period (3, 4, or 5 years). If liquidity is needed, liquid/liquid-plus mutual funds are more appropriate. For those with accumulated savings not needed in the near term, AIFs can be a reasonable investment.

---
Regulatory Differences & Market Opportunity

Q: Why are banks not allowed lending but AIFs are allowed?
A: Central banks globally restrict banks from certain activities (e.g., funding M&A, buying promoter shares) due to systemic risk concerns. For these use cases, capital must come from individuals or pooled vehicles like mutual funds/AIFs. AIFs pool money from sophisticated individuals who can choose to invest in securities funding these activities, allowing AIFs/MFs to exploit these opportunities (often at higher risk premiums) where banks cannot operate due to regulation.

---
Risk Analysis: Downside Scenarios

Q: How bad can Mosaic’s returns get? Will my money become zero?
A: Credit funds carry credit risk, especially during major crises (like GFC, COVID) where equities might see 30-50% losses and some firms default. In a hypothetical stress scenario where 10% of portfolio firms default and recovery is only 25%, a fund expected to deliver 14% might deliver 2-2.5% lower, resulting in an 11-12% return instead. (Implied: Zero return is highly unlikely but loss of some capital is possible in extreme stress).

---
Credit Fund Industry Overview & Positioning

Q: How are various credit funds or high yield funds positioned across the industry?
A: Category II AIFs exist on a spectrum:
 Performing Credit (Left): Focus on firms with no incipient stress, expecting repayment under similar conditions. Examples: ICICI, Investcorp, Edelweiss, Mosaic's Multi-Yield Fund. Expected returns: ~11–14% pre-tax. Mosaic aims for ~14%. Suitable for first-time CAT II AIF investors due to lower risk. Emphasis on return per unit of risk (Rahul Dravid style).
 Distressed Funds (Right): Bet on turnarounds of defaulted firms (higher risk/return). Repayment relies on situation improvement. Examples: 5-6 prominent players. Expected returns: ~17–18% pre-tax.
 Middle: Venture debt, special situations.
All categories generally have well-run, professional managers. Mosaic prioritizes delivering the best possible return without undue risk (Virendra Sehwag style is avoided).

---
Deal Examples

Q: What kind of deals will Mosaic have in its portfolio?
A: Here are examples of the first three deals originated/underwritten (majority DD done):

1. Real Estate (Residential Project):
 Deal: Funding a reputable Navi Mumbai developer (20+ yrs exp, strong track record, worked with 4-5 times before) for a mid-segment residential project (G+24, ~200 units, 1-1.5 Cr cost) on prime CIDCO-auctioned land. Construction <= 3 yrs.
 Mosaic Role: 65 Cr funding, >20% IRR target, 4-yr tenor (exp. ~3 yrs).
 Security: Share pledge, promoter guarantees, cash flow hypothecation, 2x land cover. (Part of larger syndicated deal).

2. Structured Finance:
 Deal: Sponsor-funding for promoter of a large, leading waste-processing company (est. ~2007/8, IIT Bombay grad founder) to acquire PE stake (e.g., from IFC). Company has little debt, policy tailwinds.
 Financials: Post-investment Debt/EBITDA ~4x (Opco level).
 Mosaic Role: ~40-45 Cr funding, ~18% IRR target.
 Security: Pledge of all promoter stake, personal guarantees, cash flow control (debt eventually moves to Holdco).

3. NBFC:
 Deal: Lending to a Pune-based rural financier (70% rural housing/30% unsecured, 5+ yr track record, ICICI Bank veteran founders). Rated BBB, AUM ~1,200 Cr, recently raised 600 Cr equity (Net worth ~950 Cr), Leverage < 1x.
 Mosaic Role: Expect 12-13 similar NBFCs in portfolio, ~25 Cr trade size each. Expected IRR ~14-15% (negotiating).
